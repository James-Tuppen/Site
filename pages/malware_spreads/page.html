                        <p>Malware can spread at any time you download <i>anything</i> from the internet.</p>
                        <h3 id="pirated-software">Pirated software</h3>
                        <p>One of the most common times I have seen people get viruses is through pirated software, especially Adobe products. From resnet.uscd.edu: "Top pirated software such as Adobe Photoshop CS5.1, Ahead Nero 10, Microsoft Office 2010, Norton 360, and various gaming software were then downloaded and executed for analyzing purposes. The research team scanned each file with Virustotal, which utilizes 43 different anti-virus scanners. Their analysis shows that about 50% of collected cracks and keygens tested are infected with malware. " (https://resnet.ucsd.edu/security/file-sharing.html, 2023)</p>
                        <h3 id="email-attachments">Email attachments</h3>
                        <p>Malwre through email attachments is also very common, as so many people will see an email and open its attachment without thinking. I have firsthand embedded binary code in PDFs, trust me - it can be done.</p>
                        <h3 id="filesharing-networks">Filesharing networks.</h3>
                        <p>Yes, this includes torrenting. And I know hashing exists, but that doesn't guarantee safety, as shown by the numerous reports of viruses spreading through torrents. Obviously, even if you are actually downloading the correct file, this does not mean the file you are downloading is safe, either. Services such as google drive automatically scan executables, to check for viruses, but this is almost never done when torrenting.</p>
                        <h3 id="webpages">Webpages</h3>
                        <p>Ever got an invalid certificate error on your browser? Or a "this site is not secure" message? Sites not supportng https or having invalid certificates are the first warning signs of possibly malicious code. When your browser says "proceed with caution", <i>it means it</i>. Exploits could range from tricks as simple as a fake onscreen keyboard, to a full computer takeover. An infamous example of this is "<a href="https://youareanidiot.cc">You Are An Idiot</a>", a site that would move the browser window around the screen and create copies of itself before showing a paywall. Luckily, this only works on very old browsers, as all new browsers have this security vunerability patched.</p>
                        <h3 id="physical-drives-or-other-external-media">Physical drives or other external media</h3>
                        <p>Anything that gets physically connected to your device could contain malicious software. Usually, you will need to manually copy a file from the device and run it for anything to be of harm, but this isn't neccessarily always the case.</p>

                        <p>Amazon's Alexas are famous for their security exploits, especially in regard to botnets and privacy. Botnets are a network of infected devices connected to the internet, which can all be controlled. This allows the devices to be used for DDOS attacks against servers, or in the case of Alexas, used to get camera and microphone information.</p>

                        <p>Phishing scams trick victims into providing personal information or access to personal and work systems by reporting fake emergencies to make them act without thinking.</p>
