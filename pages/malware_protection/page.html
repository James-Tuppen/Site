                        <h3>Built-in security</h3>
                        <p>For starters, note that almost all computers will have their own security built-in, which is often actually quite good. <em>However</em>, this is only really effective if your OS is up-to-date with new security patches. So make sure your OS is up-to-date. If you can't update to the latest OS because your hardware is too old, then stop using Apple products lol.</p>

                                <p>2FA (2 factor authentication) is the use of a secondary form of authenticaion to access something, usually alongside a password. Some services - such as Apple ID - require 2FA to be enabled. 2FA usually takes the form of a code being sent to a mobile phone or email address. This means even if someone got access to your password, they would also need access to the place being used for 2FA. Also, you can use 3FA or higher, but there's a point in which it becomes too impractical to log in to a service.</p>

                        <p>There are many good options for antiviruses out there, which can all provide an additional layer of security. However, be aware that many require payment and some such as McAfee might as well be malware itself.</p>

                                <p>BIOS (or UEFI) is a way for the user to tell the computer what drive to load the OS from, or what to do when there is no OS running. This can also be used to tell the computer to boot from an eternal drive, such as an attacker's USB. This gives access to <em>all</em> of the files on any drives connected to your computer. This can be prevented by setting a BIOS password, which makes a password neccesary to enter these options. <a href="https://www.wikihow.com/Set-a-BIOS-Password">Here's an article</a> on how to do that.</p>

                        <p>There are also many good password managers, such as iCloud Keychain or LastPass. It's worth noting that there is almost not one single password manager that hasn't been exploited at some point in time. Personally, I use paper as my password manager. Seriously, when was the last time someone hacked your pencil?</p>
                        <h3 id="keep-external-backups">Keep external backups</h3>
                        <p>Should your get ransomware on your computer, you can avoid this almost entirely by regularly backing up your files to an external drive that is pyhsically disconnected from your device unles in use. The ransomware can't access the drive if it isn't connected.</p>

                        <p>If on Windows, take some time to familiarise yourself with Task Manager and Services. These will show what is running on your computer. If you see something strange happen on your comuter, check what is running and look for something out of the ordinary. This applies to other OSes, too. If your computer isn't working like it used to, check what things have been installed or changed recently.</p>
