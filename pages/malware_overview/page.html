                        <p>Cambridge dictionary defines viruses as "a computer program or part of a computer program that can make copies of itself and is intended to prevent the computer from working normally". However, this term has been used in a much broader range of situations, which is why I prefer the term "malware". "Malware" is short for "malicious software", which has a much clearer definition. Malware is software that is designed to do something malicious, such as disrupting, damaging, or gaining unauthorized access to a computer system. If you need to report malware, do so at <a href="https://www.cyber.gov.au/threats/types-threats/malware">Cyber.gov.au</a>.</p>

                        <p>Malware could have any number of goals. Malware could even be designed to target only one particular person, for a specific reason. Some of the most common reasons for malware being created are:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>To cause disruption, or to troll people</li>
                            <li>To steal passwords or login information</li>
                            <li>To steal money</li>
                            <li>To target a specific person</li>
                        </ul>
                    </div>
                </div>

                        <h3 id="types-of-malware" class="section">Types of malware</h3>
                        <p>Types of malware include spyware, ransomware, worms and trojans. There are other less common types, such as adware, botnets, rootkits, file-less malware, and even sometimes bloatware, to some extent. Malware includes <em>any</em> malicious software though, so it is not limited to these categories. Below, I will go through many of these types of malware, explain what they are and how to prevent them.</p>

                                <p>Ransomware is relatively straightforward (when summarised). Ransomware wants your money, and it will hold something on your computer "ransom" until you pay up. Usually, to prevent extracting the data off the computer's drive, the ransomware will silently encrypt all the files on your computer, before showing you a popup with a paywall. Generally, the ransomware will, in fact, give the files back after the money is paid. This is because if people know the ransomware isn't going to give their files back anyway, nobody will pay.</p>

                                <h3 id="keyloggers" class="section">Keyloggers</h3>
                                <p>Keyloggers are a type of spyware that records every key you press, and sends it back to the hacker. This is a very effective way of stealing passwords, as the hacker can just look through the logged data to find the password. Note that the word "keylogger" is often also used to mean any kind of malicious logging, such as mouse movements, the clipboard, and even screenshots. Keyloggers are especially dangerous because they are so effective and are often not easily detected. <a target="_self" rel="noopener" href="../malware_protection/page.html#password-managers">Password managers</a> can help avoid this, as they pass the information directly to the browser.</p>

                        <h3 id="malware-usually-stays-hidden" class="section">Malware usually stays hidden</h3>
                        <p>What many people don't realise is that malware is almost always disguised as a legitimate program, and often does not show any signs of being present. Usually, the goal of these malicious programs is to steal personal information such as passwords, credit card details or account tokens. This gives the malware no reason to show itself, as it can continue to steal information from the user if it isn't removed.</p>

                        <h3 id="where-your-passwords-are-stored" class="section">Where your passwords are stored</h3>
                        <p>Storing passwords in a browser is risky. Most browsers save passwords offline, somewhere in its files. Even if the browser promises encryption, is is still possible for the malware to send the encrypted data back to the hacker to be decrypted later. There are many good password managers available, which store the information remotely and only send it to the browser as it is needed. Browsers also store "tokens". Tokens are used to identify a user, and keep them logged in even if the browser is closed. These tokens are stored extremely insecurely, and can be accessed by just opening devtools. To avoid this, don't tick any "remember me" boxes and sign out of websites when you are done.</p>
