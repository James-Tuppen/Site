### Malware
Cambridge dictionary defines viruses as "a computer program or part of a computer program that can make copies of itself and is intended to prevent the computer from working normally". However, this term has been used in a much broader range of situations, which is why I prefer the term "malware". "Malware" is short for "malicious software", which has a much clearer definition. Malware is software that is designed to do something malicious, such as disrupting, damaging, or gaining unauthorized access to a computer system.

What many people don't realise is that malware is almost always disguised as a legitimate program, and often does not show any signs of being present. One of the most common goals of these malicious programs is to steal personal information such as passwords, credit card details or account tokens. Usually, malicious programs do not have any reason to show themselves, as they can continue to steal information from the user if not removed.

Storing passwords in a browser is risky. Most browsers save passwords offline, somewhere in its files. Even if the browser promises encryption, is is still possible for the malware to send the encrypted data back to the hacker to be decrypted later. There are many good password managers available, which store the information remotely and only send it to the browser as it is needed. Browsers also store "tokens". Tokens are used to identify a user, and keep them logged in even if the browser is closed. These tokens are stored extremely insecurely, and can be accessed by just opening devtools. To avoid this, don't tick any "remember me" boxes and sign out of websites when you are done.

But the malware isn't done. Keyloggers are a type of malware that record every key you press, and send it back to the hacker. This is a very effective way of stealing passwords, as the hacker can just look through the logged data to find the password. The word "keylogger" is often also used to mean any kind of malicious logging, such as mouse movements, clicks, the clipboard, and even screenshots. Keyloggers are especially dangerous because they are so effective and are often not easily detected. Password managers can help avoid this.

Malware attacks are often carried out through phishing emails, infected attachments, or links in social media platforms like Facebook and Twitter. Malware is a serious threat to computer systems, as it can cause significant damage and compromise system security. In some cases, malware may be designed to steal sensitive information such as login credentials, financial data, or personal identification numbers (PINs). This type of malware is known as "ransomware" and has become increasingly prevalent in recent years due to the rise of cybercrime. To protect against malware attacks, it's important to keep your operating system and software up-to-date with security patches, install antivirus or anti-malware programs on your devices, use strong passwords for online accounts, avoid suspicious emails and links from unknown sources, and be cautious when opening attachments or clicking on links in social media platforms. In conclusion, malware is a serious threat to computer systems that can cause significant damage and compromise system security. It's important to take precautions against malware attacks by keeping your operating system and software up-to-date with security patches, installing antivirus programs, using strong passwords for online accounts, avoiding suspicious emails and links from unknown sources, and being cautious when opening attachments or clicking on links in social media platforms.
