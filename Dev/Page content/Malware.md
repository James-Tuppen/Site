### Malware
Cambridge dictionary defines viruses as "a computer program or part of a computer program that can make copies of itself and is intended to prevent the computer from working normally". However, this term has been used in a much broader range of situations, which is why I prefer the term "malware". "Malware" is short for "malicious software", which has a much clearer definition. Malware is software that is designed to do something malicious, such as disrupting, damaging, or gaining unauthorized access to a computer system.

What many people don't realise is that malware is almost always disguised as a legitimate program, and often does not show any signs of being present. One of the most common goals of these malicious programs is to steal personal information such as passwords, credit card details or account tokens. Usually, malicious programs do not have any reason to show themselves, as they can continue to steal information from the user if not removed.

Storing passwords in a browser is risky. Most browsers save passwords offline, somewhere in its files. Even if the browser promises encryption, is is still possible to send the encrypted data to the hacker to be decrypted later. There are many good password managers available, which store the information remotely and only send it to the browser when it is needed.

and may contain malicious code that can steal sensitive information, disrupt operations, or even infect other devices connected to the same network.
Malware attacks are often carried out through phishing emails, infected attachments, or links in social media platforms like Facebook and Twitter. Malware is a serious threat to computer systems, as it can cause significant damage and compromise system security. In some cases, malware may be designed to steal sensitive information such as login credentials, financial data, or personal identification numbers (PINs). This type of malware is known as "ransomware" and has become increasingly prevalent in recent years due to the rise of cybercrime. To protect against malware attacks, it's important to keep your operating system and software up-to-date with security patches, install antivirus or anti-malware programs on your devices, use strong passwords for online accounts, avoid suspicious emails and links from unknown sources, and be cautious when opening attachments or clicking on links in social media platforms. In conclusion, malware is a serious threat to computer systems that can cause significant damage and compromise system security. It's important to take precautions against malware attacks by keeping your operating system and software up-to-date with security patches, installing antivirus programs, using strong passwords for online accounts, avoiding suspicious emails and links from unknown sources, and being cautious when opening attachments or clicking on links in social media platforms.
