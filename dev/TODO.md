# TODO

- Fonts
- More variables
- Tables
- ZWS
- Not rely on the section class
- Make the entire nav button of the left nav buttons able to open the related page, not just the text part
- Image fitting in resizing (CSS ARGHHHHH)
- Secondary text color for light mode, along with a bunch of other things to make it supported better (it's hard to make light mode look good yikes)
- Highlight nav button by its target attribute
- Sections sorted with .row, to keep vertical alignment neat
- Sections on home link to other pages
- Add that Python code I made?
- Make dual sections resizable with calc()
- Slide-in animations for dual sections
