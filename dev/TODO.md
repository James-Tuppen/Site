# TODO

- Fonts
- Tables
- ZWS
- Not rely on the section class
- Make the entire nav button of the left nav buttons able to open the related page, not just the text part
- Secondary text color for light mode, along with a bunch of other things to make it supported better (it's hard to make light mode look good yikes)
- Highlight nav button by its target attribute
- Sections sorted with .row, to keep vertical alignment neat
- Sections on home link to other pages
- Slide-in animations for dual sections
- Remember to bold important parts of the text
- Shadows
- Footer resizing

- Make left nav bigger
- That last sentence... ehh...
- Is there a better font I could be using?
- Proper light mode support?
- Animate images (slide-in)
