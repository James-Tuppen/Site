I hope to standardise this layout, (follow other common layouts). MDN docs is a perfect example of site structuring. Pages should cover how the reader can protect themselves from these threats. Use sources and quotes.

`z-index: 0` on the navbar could be turned into a pretty epic effect.

What I learned:
- Get the base functionality down first
- Don't code in bare CSS and HTML
