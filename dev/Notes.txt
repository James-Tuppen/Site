I hope to standardise this layout, (follow other common layouts). MDN docs is a perfect example of site structuring. Pages should cover how the reader can protect themselves from these threats. Use sources and quotes.

`z-index: 0` on the navbar could be turned into a pretty epic effect.

I will give an input of MD text, to be converted to HTML. Format:
Paragraphs to <p>
###headers converted to <h3>. Give every <h3> an appropriate id, for example: <h3>Home page</h3> becomes <h3 id="home-page">Home page</h3>
- List item converted to html list
Links to HTML <a>

DO NOT CHANGE ANY OTHER TEXT

The MD text begins on the next line:

I'm not talking about the dot points after each "-", I mean the words in each paragraph that should have more meaning should bold. Don't go too crazy on it though, just a little bolding.
Command: Add bold to key phrases or sentences.
DO NOT CHANGE ANY OF THE TEXT UNLESS IT IS TO BOLD IT
