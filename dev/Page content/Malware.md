### Malware
Cambridge dictionary defines viruses as "a computer program or part of a computer program that can make copies of itself and is intended to prevent the computer from working normally". However, this term has been used in a much broader range of situations, which is why I prefer the term "malware". "Malware" is short for "malicious software", which has a much clearer definition. Malware is software that is designed to do something malicious, such as disrupting, damaging, or gaining unauthorized access to a computer system. If you need to report malware, do so at [Cyber.gov.au](https://www.cyber.gov.au/threats/types-threats/malware).

### Types of malware
Types of malware include spyware, ransomware, worms and trojans. There are other less common types, such as adware, botnets, rootkits, file-less malware, and even sometimes bloatware, to some extent. Malware includes *any* malicious software though, so it is not limited to these categories. Below, I will go through many of these types of malware, explain what they are and how to prevent them.

### Malware usually stays hidden
What many people don't realise is that malware is almost always disguised as a legitimate program, and often does not show any signs of being present. Usually, the goal of these malicious programs is to steal personal information such as passwords, credit card details or account tokens. This gives the malware no reason to show itself, as it can continue to steal information from the user if it isn't removed.

### Where your passwords are stored
Storing passwords in a browser is risky. Most browsers save passwords offline, somewhere in its files. Even if the browser promises encryption, is is still possible for the malware to send the encrypted data back to the hacker to be decrypted later. There are many good password managers available, which store the information remotely and only send it to the browser as it is needed. Browsers also store "tokens". Tokens are used to identify a user, and keep them logged in even if the browser is closed. These tokens are stored extremely insecurely, and can be accessed by just opening devtools. To avoid this, don't tick any "remember me" boxes and sign out of websites when you are done.

### Why malware exists
Malware could have any number of goals. Malware could even be designed to target only one particular person, for a specific reason. Some of the most common reasons for malware being created are:
- To cause disruption, or to troll people
- To steal passwords or login information
- To steal money
- To target a specific person

### Keyloggers
Keyloggers are a type of spyware that records every key you press, and sends it back to the hacker. This is a very effective way of stealing passwords, as the hacker can just look through the logged data to find the password. Note that the word "keylogger" is often also used to mean any kind of malicious logging, such as mouse movements, the clipboard, and even screenshots. Keyloggers are especially dangerous because they are so effective and are often not easily detected. Password managers can help avoid this, as they pass the information directly to the browser.

### Ransomware
Randsomware is relatively straightforward (when summarised). Randsomware wants your money, and it will hold something on your computer "randsom" until you pay up. Usually, to prevent extracting the data off the computer's drive, the randsomware will silently encrypt all the files on your computer, before showing you a popup with a paywall. Generally, the randsomware will, in fact, give the files back after the money is paid. This is because if people know the randsomware isn't going to give their files back anyway, nobody will pay.


### How malware spreads
Malware can spread at any time you download *anything* from the internet.
- Pirated software
One of the most common times I have seen people get viruses is through pirated software, especially Adobe products.

- Email attachments
Email attachments is also very common, as so many people will see an email and open its attachment without thinking. I have firsthand embedded binary code in PDFs, trust me it can be done.

- Filesharing networks. 
Yes, this includes torrenting. And I know hashing exists, but that doesn't guarantee safety, as shown by the numerous reports of viruses spreading through torrents. Obviously, even if you are actually downloading the correct file, this does not mean the file you are downloading is safe, either. Services such as google drive automatically scan executables, to check for viruses, but this is almost never done when torrenting.

- Webpages
Ever got an invalid certificate error on your browser? Or "this site is not secure"? Sites not supportng https or having invalid certificates are the first warning signs of possibly malicious code. When your browser says "proceed with caution", *it means it*. Exploits could range from tricks as simple as a fake onscreen keyboard, to a full computer takeover. An infamous example of this is "[You Are An Idiot](https://youareanidiot.cc)", a site that would move the browser window around the screen before showing a paywall. Luckily, this only works on very old browsers, as all new browsers have this security vunerability patched by developers  



Clicking on links to malicious websites in emails, messaging apps or social network posts
Visiting compromised websites, aka drive-by downloads, viruses can be hidden in HTML, thus downloading when the webpage loads in your browser
Connecting your device to infected external hard drives or network drives
Operating system and application vulnerabilities provide security loopholes, backdoors and other exploits
Social engineering attacks, such as phishing scams, trick victims into providing sensitive information or access to personal and work systems through customized attacks that often masquerade as legitimate organizations reporting fake emergencies to push victims to act quickly and without question
Connected peripherals, smart devices and Internet-of-Things (IoT) devices can act as vectors, or access points, or they can be hijacked and controlled remotely by the hacker

### How to protect against malware
- Built in security
- Antivirues
- Put it on paper
- Know what your computer *should* look like normally (look for out of ordinary)
- Backups for randsomware



- Social engineering
- Exploits
- Updated OS
- Bots
- Zero trust system
