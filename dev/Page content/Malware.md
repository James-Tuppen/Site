### Malware
Cambridge dictionary defines viruses as "a computer program or part of a computer program that can make copies of itself and is intended to prevent the computer from working normally". However, this term has been used in a much broader range of situations, which is why I prefer the term "malware". "Malware" is short for "malicious software", which has a much clearer definition. Malware is software that is designed to do something malicious, such as disrupting, damaging, or gaining unauthorized access to a computer system. If you need to report malware, do so at [Cyber.gov.au](https://www.cyber.gov.au/threats/types-threats/malware).

### Types of malware
Types of malware include spyware, ransomware, worms and trojans. There are other less common types, such as adware, botnets, rootkits, file-less malware, and even sometimes bloatware, to some extent. Malware includes *any* malicious software though, so it is not limited to these categories. Below, I will go through many of these types of malware, explain what they are and how to prevent them.

### Malware usually stays hidden
What many people don't realise is that malware is almost always disguised as a legitimate program, and often does not show any signs of being present. Usually, the goal of these malicious programs is to steal personal information such as passwords, credit card details or account tokens. This gives the malware no reason to show itself, as it can continue to steal information from the user if it isn't removed.

### Where your passwords are stored
Storing passwords in a browser is risky. Most browsers save passwords offline, somewhere in its files. Even if the browser promises encryption, is is still possible for the malware to send the encrypted data back to the hacker to be decrypted later. There are many good password managers available, which store the information remotely and only send it to the browser as it is needed. Browsers also store "tokens". Tokens are used to identify a user, and keep them logged in even if the browser is closed. These tokens are stored extremely insecurely, and can be accessed by just opening devtools. To avoid this, don't tick any "remember me" boxes and sign out of websites when you are done.

### Why malware exists
Malware could have any number of goals. Malware could even be designed to target only one particular person, for a specific reason. Some of the most common reasons for malware being created are:
- To cause disruption, or to troll people
- To steal passwords or login information
- To steal money
- To target a specific person

### Keyloggers
Keyloggers are a type of spyware that records every key you press, and sends it back to the hacker. This is a very effective way of stealing passwords, as the hacker can just look through the logged data to find the password. Note that the word "keylogger" is often also used to mean any kind of malicious logging, such as mouse movements, the clipboard, and even screenshots. Keyloggers are especially dangerous because they are so effective and are often not easily detected. Password managers can help avoid this, as they pass the information directly to the browser.

### Ransomware
Randsomware is relatively straightforward (when summarised). Randsomware wants your money, and it will hold something on your computer "randsom" until you pay up. Usually, to prevent extracting the data off the computer's drive, the randsomware will silently encrypt all the files on your computer, before showing you a popup with a paywall. Generally, the randsomware will, in fact, give the files back after the money is paid. This is because if people know the randsomware isn't going to give their files back anyway, nobody will pay.


### How malware spreads
Malware can spread at any time you download *anything* from the internet.
- Pirated software
One of the most common times I have seen people get viruses is through pirated software, especially Adobe products.

- Email attachments
Malwre through email attachments is also very common, as so many people will see an email and open its attachment without thinking. I have firsthand embedded binary code in PDFs, trust me - it can be done.

- Filesharing networks.
Yes, this includes torrenting. And I know hashing exists, but that doesn't guarantee safety, as shown by the numerous reports of viruses spreading through torrents. Obviously, even if you are actually downloading the correct file, this does not mean the file you are downloading is safe, either. Services such as google drive automatically scan executables, to check for viruses, but this is almost never done when torrenting.

- Webpages
Ever got an invalid certificate error on your browser? Or a "this site is not secure" message? Sites not supportng https or having invalid certificates are the first warning signs of possibly malicious code. When your browser says "proceed with caution", *it means it*. Exploits could range from tricks as simple as a fake onscreen keyboard, to a full computer takeover. An infamous example of this is "[You Are An Idiot](https://youareanidiot.cc)", a site that would move the browser window around the screen and create copies of itself before showing a paywall. Luckily, this only works on very old browsers, as all new browsers have this security vunerability patched.

- Physical drives or other external media
Anything that gets physically connected to your device could contain malicious software. Usually, you will need to manually copy a file from the device and run it for anything to be of harm, but this isn't neccessarily always the case.

- IoT devices and home assistants. Amazon's Alexas are famous for their security exploits, especially in regard to botnets and privacy. Botnets are a network of infected devices connected to the internet, which can all be controlled. This allows the devices to be used for DDOS attacks against servers, or in the case of Alexas, used to get camera and microphone information.

- Social engineering
Phishing scams trick victims into providing personal information or access to personal and work systems by reporting fake emergencies to make them act without thinking.

### How to protect against malware
- Built-in security
For starters, note that almost all computers will have their own security built-in, which is often actually quite good. *However*, this is only really effective if your OS is up-to-date with new security patches. So make sure your OS is up-to-date. If you can't update to the latest OS because your hardware is too old, then stop using Apple products lol.

- Antiviruses
There are many good options for antiviruses out there, which can all provide an additional layer of security. However, be aware that many require payment and some such as McAfee might as well be malware itself.

- Password managers
There are also many good password managers, such as iCloud Keychain or LastPass. It's worth noting that there is almost not one single password manager that hasn't been exploited at some point in time. Personally, I use paper as my password manager. Seriously, when was the last time a hacker hacked your pencil?

- Know your computer
If on Windows, take some time to familiarise yourself with Task Manager and Services. These will show what is running on your computer. If you see something strange happen on your comuter, check what is running and look for something out of the ordinary. This applies to other OSes, too. If your computer isn't working like it used to, check what things have been installed or changed recently.

- Keep *external* backups
Should your get randsomware on your computer, you can avoid this almost entirely by regularly backing up your files to an external drive that is pyhsically disconnected from your device unles in use. The randsomware can't access the drive if it isn't connected.

- Set a BIOS password
BIOS (or UEFI) is a way for the user to tell the computer what drive to load the OS from, or what to do when there is no OS running. This can also be used to tell the computer to boot from an eternal drive, such as an attacker's USB. This gives access to *all* of the files on any drives connected to your computer, without having to pyhsically remove them. It takes like 30 seconds to remove the password from a Windows PC, really. This can be prevented by setting a BIOS password, which makes a password neccesary to enter these options. [Here's an article](https://www.wikihow.com/Set-a-BIOS-Password) on how to do that. **Please note that if you forget your BIOS password, you CANNOT reset it. At all.**

- 2FA
2FA is the use of a secondary form of authenticaion to access something, usually alongside a password. Some services - such as Apple ID - require 2FA to be enabled. 2FA usually takes the form of a code being sent to a mobile phone or email address. This means even if someone got access to your password, they would also need access to the place being used for 2FA. Also, you can use 3FA or higher, but there's a point in which it becomes too impractical to log in to a service.
