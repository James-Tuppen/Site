## Maybe
### Making everyday activities easier
This could include things people do online. Maybe I could make an alt frontend for a website.
- DayMap?
- Some other school website?
### Being safe online
~~Boring, but could be done.~~ (Oh I could make this interesting) Maybe I could educate about the safety of https, proxy, vpn ect.
- Use Python to White Hat hack someone's PC. Would need to be Windows tho.
- NOTE: I made the script, maybe I could put it in one of these pages as an example?
